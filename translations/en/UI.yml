UI_Settings_Disclaimer: More game settings, including UI and notification displays
  options, will be available in the final game.
UI_Settings_ResolutionDisclaimer: Please note that the Alkimia Overdose quality preset
  might only work on very high end hardware.
UI_Loadingscreen_Hint1: In this demo you will not play as, or see the famous Nameless
  Hero
UI_Loadingscreen_Hint2: Gothic 1 Remake is an open world RPG in the spirit of the
  original Gothic
UI_Loadingscreen_Hint3: Please don't complain that the hero in this demo (Nyras) doesn't
  look like our beloved Nameless Hero.
UI_Loadingscreen_Hint4: Don't forget to join the community and wishlist the game.
  All info is available at gothic-game.com
UI_Loadingscreen_Hint5: With your support the Gothic franchise has a bright future
  ahead!
UI_Loadingscreen_Hint6: Only for this demo there is a Revive option available if you
  die. The full game won't have that but will offer save/load.
UI_Disclaimer: This demo is an isolated prequel experience created to show some of
  the main features of the Gothic 1 Remake, but since the game is still being worked
  on it can contain bugs and glitches. The full game follows the story, structure,
  and spirit of the original Gothic, with the Nameless Hero as the protagonist.
UI_StoryIntro: 'The story takes place in the mine valley of Khorinis. A penal colony
  violently taken over by its prisoners after a barrier spell went astray, the inmates
  now live in interdependency with the king, who needs them for the magical “blue
  ore” - humanity''s last hope for its losing war against the orcs.


  You are Nyras, and you have just arrived in the Colony.

UI_Attribute_Health_Tooltip: Health is your physical endurance. The more health you
  have, the more damage you can sustain before falling. Your health will increase
  with experience, keeping you resilient against ever-stronger foes.
UI_Attribute_Mana_Tooltip: Mana fuels your magical abilities. Mana is consumed while
  casting spells and does not regenerate independently, so plan your rest and item
  consumption accordingly.
UI_Attribute_Strength_Tooltip: Strength expresses your physical prowess. The greater
  your strength, the more powerful weapons you can wield and the more damaging your
  melee attacks will be.
UI_Attribute_Dexterity_Tooltip: Dexterity represents your mastery, balance and control
  over your body. It determines the ranged weapons you can use and improves your ranged
  attack effectiveness and chance of success while pickpocketing.
UI_Attribute_MagicCircle_Tooltip: Magic Circles signify the depth of a wizard's wisdom
  and knowledge in the arcane arts. As you ascend through the circles, you gain access
  to more intricate and potent spells, amplifying your magical prowess.
UI_Attribute_Toughness_Tooltip: Toughness is a measure of your ability to bear encumbrance.
  As you grow tougher, you can carry more items. Overburdening yourself will hinder
  your movement, so manage your inventory wisely.
UI_Protection_Physical_Tooltip: Provides defense against both the cutting edges of
  swords and axes, and the crushing blows of maces, minimizing the impact of direct
  physical attacks.
UI_Protection_Arrows_Tooltip: This protection reduces the piercing damage from arrows
  and bolts.
UI_Protection_Magic_Tooltip: Fortifies your defenses against the forces of the arcane.
  This protection lessens their impact, whether it's a chilling ice spell or a thundering
  shock.
UI_Protection_Fire_Tooltip: Designed to shield against the intense heat of flames,
  this protection ensures you're less affected by fire-based attacks and hazards.
UI_Fighting_OneHanded_Tooltip: Your proficiency with one-handed weapons determines
  your combat efficiency, from basic swings to fluid and masterful combinations.
UI_Fighting_OneHanded_Untrained_Tooltip: You are untrained. You can wield a weapon.
  Do not expect finesse; combos and parries are beyond your grasp.
UI_Fighting_OneHanded_Trained_Tooltip: With training you movements become fluid, enabling
  attack combinations and skillful parries. You can deliver critical hits and have
  the capability to cancel attacks midway.
UI_Fighting_OneHanded_Master_Tooltip: A master of one-handed combat is a force to
  be reckoned with. Your chance for critical strikes is heightened, and you can cause
  knockbacks. Parrying becomes second nature, allowing for strong counterattacks.
UI_Fighting_TwoHanded_Tooltip: Your skill with two-handed weapons defines your capacity
  in battle, from raw strikes to graceful and dominating combinations.
UI_Fighting_TwoHanded_Untrained_Tooltip: You are untrained. You can grip a two-handed
  weapon, but its full potential remains elusive. Combos and parries are beyond your
  reach, and your attacks are simple and unrefined.
UI_Fighting_TwoHanded_Trained_Tooltip: With training your control over two-handed
  weapons becomes fluid, allowing you to weave powerful combinations and skilled parries.
  Critical hits become possible, and you gain the ability to cancel attacks.
UI_Fighting_TwoHanded_Master_Tooltip: As a master of two-handed combat, your prowess
  is formidable. Critical strikes become more frequent, parrying allows counterattacks,
  and your powerful swings can send foes reeling with knockbacks.
UI_Fighting_Crossbow_Tooltip: Your command of crossbows reflects your ranged combat
  mastery, evolving from basic handling to quick and precise shooting.
UI_Fighting_Crossbow_Untrained_Tooltip: You are untrained. You can operate crossbows,
  but your unsteady hands may prove aiming, and reloading is slow and tedious.
UI_Fighting_Crossbow_Trained_Tooltip: With training your prowess with the crossbow
  grows. Reloading is faster, your aim steadies and critical hits become a real threat.
UI_Fighting_Crossbow_Master_Tooltip: You achieve mastery over crossbows. Critical
  strikes come with greater ease, each shot boasts unmatched accuracy, and your deft
  hands reload the bolts swiftly.
UI_Fighting_Bow_Tooltip: Your skill with bows defines your marksmanship, from basic
  aiming to precise and swift shots.
UI_Fighting_Bow_Untrained_Tooltip: You are untrained. You can hold a bow, but aiming
  is challenging, and drawing and reloading feels cumbersome.
UI_Fighting_Bow_Trained_Tooltip: With training your bow skills have sharpened. You
  are now much more proficient reloading and aiming your bow, and your increased precision
  allows for critical hits.
UI_Fighting_Bow_Master_Tooltip: Your control over the bow is masterful. Your critical
  hits devastate your enemies, and the swiftness and precision of your shots overwhelm
  them.
