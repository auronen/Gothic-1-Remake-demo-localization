Orry-CH0-None-Orry-35350: Freshie, eh? Didn't know one was comin' in. You got lucky.
Orry-CH0-None-Hero-62484: Why?
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-81876: Well, if it wasn't for the rockslide, 'couple of our lads
  would've been right there to welcome you.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-50913: 'With a proper stompin''. '
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-3202: Anyway. If you're headed for the valley, you gotta wait 'til
  our men clear the path. The precipice-
Orry-CH0-None-Hero-17889: '- is too dangerous to climb. I know, Diego told me. '
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-90220: Good. Best find yourself somewhere to sleep, then.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-3825: 'Had enough? '
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-51104: 'Good. '
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-21801: 'Beliar''s Balls ... I''ll hand it to you, you pack a bleedin''
  punch. '
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-21502: Get going. You had your chance.
Orry-CH0-None-Hero-93802: What's your story? Why'd they throw you in?
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-34664: What, me? Ain't nothin' to write home about.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-1321: I ran outta dough, then fell in with the wrong crowd, and
  then right into a group o' guards after I mugged someone.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-45461: Bingo, here I am. Yourself?
Orry-CH0-None-Caption-85953-0: I killed someone.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-24602: You? Didn't peg you for the type.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-37552: Don't tell everyone, though - or at least only the ones
  that you think wanna hear it.
Orry-CH0-None-Hero-17139: I won't.
Orry-CH0-None-Caption-7105-0: I was at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-97807: Heard that one before.
Orry-CH0-None-Caption-16021-0: I don't want to talk about it.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-84803: What, no heart to heart? Fine by me.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-50138: It's always the same story, anyway.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-57035: I have some questions.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-74214: 'That so? Well, what I have is a parched throat. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-3732: 'How''s this, you find me a bevvy, then you can
  ask like there''s no tomorrow. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-31914: One hand washes the other.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-67257: What sort of drink do you want?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-96594: 'What I want is a Varantian Red, Vintage 82
  and a foxy redhead to pour it for me. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-2862: Sadly, this is the Colony, so a bottle of the
  swill the king sells us as "beer" has got to do.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-28969: 'Sounds like a deal. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-103: 'Innos''s praise. You know where to find me. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-42210: I don't have time for this.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-28733: That would be beneath you, eh?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-31985-0: 'Oh, my lad, you''re in for a rude awakenin''.  '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-22970: Here's your beer.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-69058: My savior!
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-30075: 'Ugh ... tastes like ballsweat. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-62196: 'Anyway. You had questions, right? Fire away. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-36883: 'Can''t you let me sleep in the exchange zone?
  Just until they''ve cleared the rubble? '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-5926: 'Not until you''ve joined the Old Camp, mate.
  As I''m sure Diego already told you. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-26122: What if you sign me up right now?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-60815: 'There''s only one man who can do that, and
  that''s Gomez. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-62379: 'And frankly, unless you got what it takes to
  become a Shadow or a warder, think twice whether you really wanna join us. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-8934: Most green-bloods, they just give a pickaxe and
  have 'em mine nuggets for the rest of their lives. You don't want that.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-31470: If not in the "Exchange Zone," where can I sleep?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-72919: Ground won't do?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-35560: Diego said they saw a shadowbeast near the canyon.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-11063: Oh, right, I remember. Bollocks, tough luck.
  Maybe try the old diggers' camp up on the ledge across the flooded mine.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-57449: 'Though I think I saw some folks messin'' about
  around there ... New Campers, maybe. You''ll find out.  '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Caption-18442-0: 'What''s it like in the Old Camp?  '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-7851: 'Could be better, could be worse. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-47911: In what sense?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-67623: Well, if you make nice with the bloodhounds,
  it's probably your best bet for a normal life here.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-45936: 'If you piss off the wrong guys, though ... '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-90405: I get it.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-75124: Where can I find a weapon?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-21858: 'Well, not from us. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-10311: Maybe try the area around the Abandoned Mine.
  There's probably still some old tools, or maybe even a blade up there.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-59001: What about a proper sword?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-10367: 'That, you''ll have to take or buy from someone. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-62457: 'Word of advice? Be grateful for whatever you
  get in here, and try not to come across like the world owes you somethin''. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-79853: 'Cause it doesn''t. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-54075: All right. I'll take a look.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-21881: Do that.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-21109: How about some general advice? About life in
  the Colony?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-18513: Make your peace with it.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-81881: With being here?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-34140: 'Yeah. This place is your home now, and you''re
  here to stay - no matter what the rice-eaters or the cultists will try and tell
  you. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-42085: Once you've gotten that into your head, life
  can be quite all right in here.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Caption-6832: Rice-eaters and cultists?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-6832: Rice-eaters and cultists?
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-25768: You'll find out.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Caption-43544: Sounds bleak.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-43544: Sounds bleak.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-71564: You'll come around.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Caption-72854: 'I''m not gonna stay in here. '
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-50029: I don't plan on growing old in here.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-49997: So said they all.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Caption-12002: Maybe you're right.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-77217: You're probably right.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-96478: I wish I wasn't.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Hero-37302: That's all. Thanks.
Orry-CH0-G1RDemo_OrryBeer-Orry-14126: Sure. Stay alive.
Orry-CH0-None-Hero-88403: I have to tell you something. Kirgo is dead.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-44358: '... What? Why? How?'
Orry-CH0-None-Caption-88176-0: I think it was the shadowbeast.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-51220: The - but I saw him this mornin'! Fuck ... FUCK!
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-45442: I can't leave me post right now, but I'll look for him first
  thing tomorrow.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-22759: 'Then we''ll see who did this. Anyway ... thanks for tellin''
  me. '
Orry-CH0-None-Caption-12927-0: It was an accident. We had a practice fight, and my
  sword slipped.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-36012: An ... accident?
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-21384: 'No. No, I ain''t buyin'' it, Kirgo was one of the best
  fighters in the arena. '
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-10752: You did this, and you did it on purpose. Crazy bastard ...
  I'll fuckin' end you!
Orry-CH0-None-Hero-73692: I'll be on my way.
Orry-CH0-None-Orry-52966: Sure. Good luck, green-blood.
