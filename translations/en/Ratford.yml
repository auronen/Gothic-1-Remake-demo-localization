Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-64245-1: Now who by Beliar are you?
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-87298: I'm Nyr-
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-66784: 'Not your name. You don''t look like you''re from
  any of the camps - you a digger? Or did they just throw you in? '
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-42595: I'm new, yes. Your friend Drax sent me to help you, in
  return for a place to sleep at your camp.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-50882: Did he, now? Well, I don't need any help, especially
  not from a wet lettuce like you, and I sure as fuck ain't gonna have a stranger
  sleep by our fire.  Now get lost.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-30527: But your friend and I made a deal.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-72328: 'Yeah, you and him, but not me. Drax''s a gullible
  fool who''d offer an orc a beer cause it''s such a nice day. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-4113-0: Sorry, but it ain't happening.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-99079-1: Good luck out there.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-34959: What can I do to convince you?
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-35655: 'Look, I ain''t tryin'' to be an arse, I really ain''t.
  But I don''t know you, and trustin'' folk you don''t know is the best way to get
  yourself killed in here. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-26237: Watch your fucking mouth.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-60669: Big mistake.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-69849: Fine.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-45016: Sorry, mate. You'll find somethin' else.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-81996: They just threw me in. I'm looking for a safe place to
  sleep.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-13684: 'Then go to the Old Camp. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-15424: That Varantian said I should wait until the diggers clear
  the rockslide.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-99940: 'Then do that. Look, I ain''t got nothin'' for you,
  green-blood, okay? Sod off. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-14986: What?
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-74210: What's your problem?
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-1706: Got a few, actually. One of them is the idiot in front
  of me who just doesn't know when to shut it.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-28264: Are you also from that "New Camp"‚Äù
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-73615: How did you guess?
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-91268: I'll be going.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-40335: Mm.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-40635: Who are you?
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-63229: 'I found him like this. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-52590: I know, I'd have heard the fightin'. Who are you?
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-18505: I'm new here. I was just looking for a safe place to
  sleep and found him like this.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-16882: A green-blood? I thought they weren't bringin' any
  today.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-55046: Well, I'm here.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-81347: 'Hmm. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-80505: Fine. I believe you.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-57489: Don't point that thing at me.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-67380: Wrong answer.
Ratford_CURSE_01_v5: Damn.
Ratford_CURSE_01_v14: Fuck it.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-29260: You again.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-22878: 'I think I found your man. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-80190: 'I can see that. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-44653: Let's see what he has on him.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-63489: What's that?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-7287-0: 'A letter? '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-43548-0: 'No, a drawing. And there''s these symbols. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-41888-0: '... Huh. Must have scribbled that while
  he was baked. You keep it. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-9744-0: What now? Are you gonna take him back to
  your camp?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-23899-0: 'No. We''ll stay the night, head back
  to our camp tomorrow, and tell our boss that Jorik''s dead. End of story. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-72836-0: So ... you said you're lookin' for somewhere
  safe to camp, didn't you? Probably a good idea with that shadowbeast prowlin' the
  area.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-90162-0: Yeah.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-32267-0: 'Hm. Ah, well, fuck it - you can sleep
  at our fire. It''s in that old diggers'' camp across the Abandoned Mine, that thing
  won''t come there. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-9934-0: Just like that?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-90459-0: 'If you ain''t messed about in them
  bushes, I probably wouldn''t have found our man before nightfall. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-25858-0: 'Okay. Thanks. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-32619-0: 'I should be thanking you - if you ain''t
  messed about in them bushes, I probably wouldn''t have found our man before dark. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-33264-0: 'So, Drax promised you a place in our
  camp, eh? Beliar''s Balls, that man ... '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-39243-0: I helped him hunt ...
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-47000-0: 'Did you. Ah, well, fuck it - if you
  ain''t messed about in them bushes, I probably wouldn''t have found our man before
  nightfall. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-25814-0: 'You''ll get your sleeping spot, and
  you''ll get some dinner as well - sorry ''bout earlier, it just pays to keep your
  guard up in this shitehole. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-71877-0: 'Oh, and just so we''re clear, that
  ''sorry'' doesn''t go for givin'' you a pastin'' earlier. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-88688-0: 'If anythin'', see it as a lesson. I
  left it at a shiner, but some of the blokes in here would gladly do you in if you
  mouth off at ''em like that. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-36744-0: Anyway.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-32587-0: 'That said, there ain''t gonna be any
  dinner before me mate Drax hunts us some scavs. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-15507-0: How about you give him a hand? Just
  so he can get to know you.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-94901-0: 'Where can I find him? '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-26907-1: 'Just follow the road into the valley,
  he should be somewhere around there. I''ll meet you at the camp.  '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-26907-2: 'I''ll meet you at the camp.  '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-62191-1: Me mate, Drax, should be down in the
  camp already. Come on, let's go.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-15303-1: Come on, let's head back down. Drax
  should be in the camp already.
TEXT_HECTO_20230817_110702_41: So, he's dead ... fuck. Must have been that shadowbeast.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-46542: You knew him?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-56356: He was from our gang, so yeah. It's why
  me and me mate are here.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-24422: Drax said he was one of you?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-53323: 'From our gang, yeah. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-72197: The fool got hooked on those herb rolls
  the cultists sell and started losin' his marbles.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-41347: Last time I saw him, he went on about
  how their god was talkin' to him in his sleep, nutty stuff like that.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-76574: And then, a week ago, he just wandered
  outta our camp in the dead o' the night and didn't come back.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-41798: A god spoke to him in his dream?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-90716: '"Whispered," I think was how he put it,
  but yeah. That''s what those herbs do to you. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-52915: Are you talking about swamp weed?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-28568: 'Yeah. There''s a bog in the Valley, and
  the sect that lives there grows and sells it. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-82831: Apparently they smoke it 'cause it "opens
  their mind to their god," but lots of folk outside the sect use it too 'cause it
  takes the edge off.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-3445: What's that cult you're talking about?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-56576: Right ... you're new here.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-61788: 'Long and short of it, there''s three
  camps in the Colony, and one of them is a sect. '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-95458: Word is, their chief lunatic had some
  vision six years ago that some old god was about to wake up and save 'em all, so
  they moved to the swamp. Been livin' there ever since.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Caption-40855-0: That god - is he real?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-87472: '''Course not. That master of theirs,
  Y''Berion, is just playin'' on how desperately they wanna get out.  '
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-99331: Look, I found this on your man.
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-99334: What now?
Ratford-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Ratford-23614-3: Did you check his corpse?
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-26027: 'What? Let''s find Drax. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-36270: That camp you're from - what's it like?
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-97063: 'The New Camp, you mean? It''s okay. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-72398: You gotta take care of yourself, but if you can do
  that, you're a lot freer than in the other camps.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-18169: Oh, and of course, the Water Mages who live with us
  think they can get us outta here.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-85496: Really? How?
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-7074: 'They wanna blow up a pile of blue ore - which, if
  you ask me, is as stupid as it sounds. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-42915: 'Honestly, our camp''s all right, but just forget
  about that pony. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-86658: 'Old Camp, New Camp, Swamp Camp ... we ain''t getting''
  outta here. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-78201: That's just how it is.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-63685: How did you end up in here?
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-21599: 'Look - I owe you for findin'' Jorik, but that don''t
  mean we''re friends now. '
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-67954: Try Drax if you're so eager to chat. That man natters
  like a washerwoman after a bottle of rum.
Ratford-CH0-None-Hero-75802: All right.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-44688: Not now.
Ratford-CH0-None-Ratford-13165: What? You want another pastin'? Get lost.
TEXT_WIP_JNJMDGE_20240715_153503: Sod off.
