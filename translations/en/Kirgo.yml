Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-13159: Look at that, a fresh face. They just threw you in?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Caption-90162: They did.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-61590: They did.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-72322: Well, then welcome to the Colony, I guess. What's your
  name? I'm Kirgo.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-54970: Nyras.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-53995: 'Good to meet you. Hey, listen, why don''t we chat for
  a bit? You could tell me the latest from the outside, and I give you some advice
  that''ll help you stay alive here. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-48505: It's just that I've been shoveling that bloody rubble
  all day, and I'd kill for a distraction. What do you say?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Caption-56351: Why do you care what happens on the outside?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-5576: Why do you care what happens on the outside, anyway? We're
  never getting out of here, are we?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-48595: 'Well, the New Campers and the guys from the swamp would
  beg to differ. But yeah, you''re right, we probably won''t. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-58994: Still, I think it helps to remind yourself from time to
  time that the world doesn't start and end at that stupid blue dome. I'd go crazy
  if I didn't.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-57845: 'How about I tell you in return for a safe place to sleep? '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-75065: Like one of your huts?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-5289: Because of that shadowbeast, huh? I'd let you sleep in
  there if it were up to me, but it's not. Sorry, friend.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-75802-0: All right.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-49599-0: 'Honestly, though, there isn''t that much tell. Everyone''s
  on edge because of the war, and all the horror stories that are going around about
  the orcs don''t help. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-7847: 'There''s word that the Nordmarians made some small victories,
  though, so there''s that. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-86946: Thank Innos. Let's hope they can reclaim some of the mining
  areas - there's no way we in here can keep up with the demand long-term, no matter
  how many prisoners the king sends here.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-51889: What about Khorinis city? Did you get a chance to see
  it during the transfer?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-69630: Not really. They had me locked up the whole time.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-15646: Shame. Ah, man, I miss that place ... I lived there for
  a couple of years after I left Varant. Had a woman there ... Rosa.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-28860-0: 'She was the sweetest thing you could ever imagine,
  and a better soul than I''ll ever be.  '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-50097: 'Ah, shit, here I am, rambling like a drooling old man.
  Sorry. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-42421: I don't have the time for this.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-13085: Hm. Shame. But all right, your call.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-73711: None of your business.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-8473: 'Not the talkative type, are you? Fine by me, but I''d
  watch that tone if I were you. Lone wolves don''t make it far in here. '
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-87315: Ouch ... well, I didn't see that coming.
  Not bad ... you got potential. Still, I think I could teach you some tricks. You're
  still interested?
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-54063-0: Sure, why not.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-565-0: All right. Number one, when you're using
  a weapon like this, hold it in one hand, not in both. Once you built the muscles,
  you'll be much more agile and can string your attacks together.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-95345-0: Two, if you're already in a strike, and
  realize it's gonna throw you right into a riposte, pull back and dodge. It'll take
  some practice to get right, but you can do it.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-35698: And finally, when you parry, try to time
  it to the perfect moment. That'll throw your opponent off and give you an opening.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-55473-0: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-83210-0: 'Anytime. You should really find yourself
  a campsite now, though - it''ll be dark soon. '
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-35355: Good fight! I hope I didn't break anything?
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-61657: '... It''s all right.'
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-59331: 'Happy to hear it. You''re not bad, friend
  - you need some practice, but you got potential. Want me to teach you some tricks? '
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-10101: 'And finally, when you parry, try to time
  it to the perfect moment, that''ll leave your opponent wide open. '
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-55473: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-83210: 'Anytime. You should really find yourself
  a campsite now, though - it''ll be dark soon. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-65501: Not bad ... I didn't see that one coming.
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-30285-0: Anyway, I've got to get back to work now. See you around
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-22502: Well fought. You're getting there!
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-97338: Good chat.
TEXT_HECTO_20230814_160412_686: (End conversation)
Kirgo-CH0-None-Hero-24591: Is it true that there's no women in here? At all?
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-12464: 'Only the ones the ore barons keep for their amusement.
  But if you bat as much as an eye at them, Gomez will have you whipped to the bone. '
Kirgo-CH0-None-Kirgo-85213: There's a rumor about a couple who escaped and are hiding
  somewhere, but I doubt it. People just love to talk ... and drink ... and talk some
  more.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-99779: Your turn. What's your advice?
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-70361: Join the Old Camp. We're the heart of the
  Colony - all the stuff they send us from outside, they bring it to us.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-25026: Unless there's a rockslide ...
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-58252: Don't worry about that, our boys will have
  that cleared in no time. Gomez is tough, but he knows how to keep this place running.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-59810: '"Gomez" is your boss?'
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-34033: He's the most powerful man in the Old Camp,
  yeah. He led the prison revolt back then and took charge.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-18590: He's the guy who tells the king what we
  want for our ore. And the king delivers.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-26319: I see.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-52548: One more thing - you look like you've held
  a sword before. You wouldn't care for a practice match, would you?
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-630: ' I got a fight coming up next week, and I
  could show you some tricks in return.'
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-1372: You have a "fight coming up?"
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-68105: Yeah, in the arena. You'll see it.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-91130: Sorry, but I really gotta go.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-3837: Shame. Well, maybe some other day.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-95013: 'All right, why not.  '
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-63047: Great! Just let me know when you're ready.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-41448: Yeah, sure. I'll be here for a bit longer.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-64994: I'm ready to fight.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-65948-6: All right. Let's dance.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-39679: What, without a weapon? Get yourself one
  first, otherwise this won't be any fun for you.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-21333: Why are you so friendly, anyway?
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-42430-0: You make it sound like that's a bad thing.
  I don't know. Maybe it's because folk in here tend to look they haven't had a shit
  in a decade, so I'm trying to balance it out.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-57048: How about a rematch?
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-70786: Hm, why not. Get yourself a weapon first,
  though.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-48441: What, already? Sure. Just say the word.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-23822: Let's fight.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-18035: All right. Show me what you got!
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-92998: Don't hold back this time. Give it all you
  got.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-72913: You sure about that? All right, let's dance.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-17711: Give me a moment.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Kirgo-27576: Okay. You know where to find me.
Kirgo-CH0-G1RDemo_KirgoFight-Hero-79373: Maybe later.
