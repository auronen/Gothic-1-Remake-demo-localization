Diego-CH0-None-Diego-35455: Still alive? Good. I'm Diego.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-33246: 'I''m Ny- '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-43084: 'No one in here cares about your name, lad - unless you
  give them a reason to. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-67833: Look, usually I'm the guy who gives the "green bloods"
  the rundown, but a rockslide cut us off from the valley, so I have other things
  on my mind right now.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-98606: 'Our men are coming to clear the path, but knowing them,
  it''s gonna take a few days, so you should find yourself a place to camp until then. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-91856: All clear?
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-76137: Can I help you somehow?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-12922: 'Thanks, but no. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-91834: Where can I camp? Somewhere in here?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-20055: 'No. This Exchange Zone belongs to the Old Camp, and until
  you''re one of us, we can''t let you wander around here after dark. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-35601-0: 'Just try and find somewhere well sheltered. Our boys
  sighted a shadowbeast near the canyon, and they come out at night.  '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-11753: Wait. A real shadowbeast?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-26027: In the flesh. One of the many things in this place just
  waiting to rip you to pieces.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-25858: 'Okay. Thanks. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-3476: 'Sure. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-73935: Welcome to the Colony.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-24707: What is it?
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-91769: About this ... barrier. Is it really true that you can't
  go back out once you're in?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-51663: You can. Anytime.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-43033: But?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-5080: But that thing will hit your arse with a lightning bolt
  so nasty even the vultures won't wanna touch what's left of you.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-90410: What exactly do you do? Are you with the guys who run the
  Colony?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-94012: 'If you mean the Old Camp, then yes, I am - though I''m
  only a Shadow. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-55986: '"Shadow?"'
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-3860: 'Yes. I guess you could call us the all-rounders of the
  camp. But you''ll pick it up. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-29785: I guess this "Old Camp" is the main settlement in the Colony?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-38850: 'Well, it''s the oldest one. Our leader, Gomez, and his
  men founded it right after the revolt. It''s built around the castle where the old
  prison guards used to live. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-10718: But there are others?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-48329: Why do you ask?
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-26492: I'm just curious.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-90638: 'You''ll have to find out yourself. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-58079: 'How did you end up in here? '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-7105: I was at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-81111: Meaning ...?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-45278: That I was at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-36443: Where can I get a weapon?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-67611: Not from here - that's Old Camp property. Just look around
  the canyon, there's bound to be something. Even if it's just a rusty pickaxe.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-31895: 'You WILL let me sleep in here. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-68146: Watch yourself, lad. Are you sure you wanna go down that
  route?
Diego-CH0-None-Caption-72690: 'You''re an old man. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-72690: 'You''re an old man. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-85201: Then let's get this over with.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-91798: I'm just joking.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-10917: Well, don't. This prison's full of killjoys.
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-6226: 'There was an accident. Kirgo''s dead. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-31204: '... What?'
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-9564: We had a practice fight, and it didn't end well. I figured
  I should tell you.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-50517: 'Let me get this straight: you killed one of our men,
  and you came back to tell me?'
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-99938: More or less.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-4242: '... You are either extremely honest or extremely dumb.
  Godsdammit, this day keeps getting worse.'
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-74131: 'Get out of the Exchange Zone and keep your head low. '
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-75116: 'And forget everything I said about going to the Old Camp
  once our guys clear the path. You''re out. '
Diego-CH0-None-Caption-96231-0: You're not going to kill me?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-16593: Do you want me to?
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-54250: No.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-95015: 'Then don''t ask stupid questions. '
Diego-CH0-None-Caption-69944-0: Aren't you impressed?
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-94971: Am I-
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-76598: 'I''m not sure if you''re trying to be funny, but I''m
  running out of patience. '
TEXT_MATTM_20230808_122333: All right?
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-67451: All right. Thank you.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-31013: Don't give me that. It was an accident, and you're not
  going to die for it.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-1177: 'Now go. And whatever you do, DON''T tell Orry. '
Diego-CH0-None-Hero-91268-1: I'll be going.
Diego-CH0-None-Diego-2972: Sure.
Diego-CH0-G1RDemo_SafePlacetoSleep-Diego-26253: Find somewhere to sleep before it
  gets dark, green-blood. You don't wanna run into that shadowbeast.
