Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-89011: Wait a second. You're the guy they just tossed
  in, aren't you? No, don't say anything, I know it.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-20861: You just got that "what the fuck did I get myself
  into" look on your face.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-9657: I am new, yes - but actually, your friend Ratford,
  sent me.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-46836: 'He said I can sleep in your camp, and told
  me to help you hunt. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-58516: Rats? Did he find Jorik, then?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-8890: He's dead.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-97866: '... I see. Shame, but not that surprising.'
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-26302: So, you're here to help me hunt ... how nice
  of you. Well, why not. Let's do it.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-10911: I'm guessing you already know we're stuck up
  here?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-43176: Yeah. I'm looking for a place to camp - apparently
  there's a shadowbeast out here.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-70619: There IS. We saw it too ... it's a big bloody
  bastard.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-49351: Hmm ... hey, why don't we make a deal? You help
  me hunt that flock of scavs, and in return, we share the food, and you can sleep
  at our fire.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-43533: It's in the old miner's camp across the flooded
  mine, and it's well sheltered. What do you say?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-47782: '"Our" fire?'
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-87244: Yeah, me and my friend's. You'll meet him.
Drax-CH0-None-Hero-72487: 'Your Common doesn''t sound like you''re from Khorinis.  '
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-86382: And neither does yours.
Drax-CH0-None-Hero-57725: Where are you from? Midlands?
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-47752: 'Maybe I am, maybe I''m not. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-80576: 'How do I know this isn''t a trap? '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-27434: You mean, am I the big bad villain who wants
  to rob the poor freshie of all his nonexistent nuggets?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-91704: No offense, friend, but if I had a problem with
  you, you'd already be dead.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-61662-0: What's in this for you? You look like you
  could kill those scavs yourself.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-66721: Ain't you a wary one. Good! First, I remember
  what it was like to get tossed in here and have everyone trying to fuck me over.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-59742: Second, if it turns out you're at least a LITTLE
  less useless than the average freshie, I might just tell you to piss on what Diego
  probably told you and try joining OUR camp - the New Camp - instead.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-43603: The one where you don't have to blow sugar up
  Gomez's ass for the rest of your life.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-26481: But that can wait. First we hunt.
TEXT_DAVID_20230811_170556_41: Does that gang of yours have a leader?
TEXT_DAVID_20230811_170615: 'Yeah, it does - Lares. But again, it''s not like in the
  Old Camp. We follow his lead because he''s the best man for the job, and that''s
  it. The moment that changes, he''d step down.  '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-66022: Deal. What's the strategy?
TEXT_DAVID_20230811_170008: There ain't one. Those birds are dumb as rocks, so you
  charge in and make short of them.
TEXT_DAVID_20230811_170018: Just don't let them surround you. Tell me when you're
  ready, then we go.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-34325: Not interested.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-97644-2: Not a people's person, eh? Stupid call, if
  you ask me, but fine. Just keep your hands off from those scavengers, or I might
  mistake you for one of them.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-83832: Hey! Hold it, you'll scare the-
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-18631: Ha! That's some sweet bounty.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-16681: I was gonna gut them here, but if Rats is already
  in the camp, let's not waste any more time. I'll meet you there, new guy! Good job.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-55131: 'Ha! Good job, that''s some sweet bounty. You
  know how to gut? '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Hero-55641-0: 'Well ... '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-59799-0: Nevermind, I can do it. Come to think of
  it, maybe you could go find my friend Ratford while I'm at it and see if he needs
  a hand.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-21285-0: One of our crew, Jorik, has gone missing
  and we think he's somewhere in the canyon. Rats is looking for him right now. I'll
  see you at the campfire.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-80360: Plans ain't your thing, are they? Oh well,
  whatever. We got 'em. You know how to gut?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Hero-91969-0: '"Crew?"'
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-9536-0: 'Yeah, our gang. The Reds call us "bandits,"
  but I don''t think that''s fair. We''re so much more. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Hero-86916-0: I take it your gang runs this "New Camp"
  you mentioned earlier?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-45745-0: '"Run" isn''t the word I''d use. I mean,
  yeah, there are factions and all, but there''s no fixed rules or proper, what''s
  the word, "hierarchies." '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-77367-0: 'As I said though, let''s talk about it once
  I got that scav speared-up and sizzling over the fire.  '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Hero-96179-0: 'What happened to this Jorik? '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-63260-0: 'Well, that''s what we''re here to find out.
  The man just wandered off and ain''t come back since. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-56611-0: Someone saw him climbing around this canyon,
  here, but, so far, nothing.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Hero-29676-0: What does your friend Ratford look like?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-46680-2: 'My size, black hair, big mustache. He wears
  the same armor that I''m wearing, so he should be easy to spot. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-94407-0: 'Bring him back down here when you''ve found
  Jorik - I should have the fire and dinner ready by then. Oh, and by the way: I''m
  Drax.'
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-50312: Forget about the scavs.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-62484: Why?
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-43473: '''Cause someone killed them while I wasn''t
  looking. I''m SURE it wasn''t you.'
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-95185: 'Well, fuck it, I''m heading back to camp. Gonna
  be jerky for dinner ... '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-78430: 'Let''s go. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-1376: But what about our deal? I still need somewhere
  to sleep.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-70710: Yeah, and I sympathize, I really do. Alas, nothing
  in this life is free.
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-40881: Go look around - I'm sure you'll find someplace
  else.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-59532: I bloody warned you!
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-81717: You shouldn't have come here!
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_FindJorik-Drax-96572: 'Hm? Go find Rats. He should be somewhere in
  the canyon. '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Drax-57366: Sorry, friend, you made your choice. Good luck
  out there.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-54567: So you made a friend, Rats! Didn't think I'd see the day.
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-71939: Piss off. You got our dinner?
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-85556: Yeah, the new lad helped me. You found Jorik, eh? What killed
  him?
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-33049: Probably that shadowbeast. We gotta be careful tonight.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-88422: 'So, tell me, freshie: when you found Jorik, did you find
  out why he wandered off as well? Honestly, I still don''t get it. '
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-95327: I've smoked more rolls than a furnace, and no god has yet
  "whispered into my dreams."
Drax-CH0-None-Hero-68340: Well, he did have this drawing. Wait, I have it.
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-90529: Keep that paper in your pants and don't talk about this
  shite. Jorik smoked too much and lost his marbles, end of story.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-44226: Beliar's Balls, calm down, man. It was just a question.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-54188: 'Something else, then. You probably figured out by now that
  there''s three camps in the Colony. '
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-73206: 'I''ll be upfront: seeing as you ain''t half as useless
  as most of the folk they toss in here, you should try and join ours. '
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-52326: You're making it sound like we're a flock of ladies waitin'
  to throw our breechcloths at him.
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-68439: 'Drax''s right, though, we could use new men, and you
  might have what it takes. That said, if you don''t wanna end up pluckin'' rice,
  you''re gonna have to work hard for it. '
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-15941: That's true wherever he goes. At least we have a plan that'll
  get us outta here, and a proper one at that, not some cultist bullshit about sleeping
  gods.
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-70406: 'If you still think that ''let''s blow up a pile of blue
  ore'' nonsense is gonna work, you''re as away with the faeries as the Loons are. '
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-94638: I mean, how much ore have they dug up by now, enough
  to buy all the deserts of Varant? But somehow, whenever you ask the mercs when the
  mages finally have enough, it's always "just a little more."
Drax-CH0-None-Ratford-61772: 'Seriously, I''m startin'' to wonder if they ain''t just
  playin'' games with us like that Y''Berion bloke does with his lambs. I wouldn''t
  be surprised... '
Drax-CH0-G1RDemo_DraxHunt-Hero-36233: Let's hunt.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-27879: Music to my ears. You got a weapon?
Drax-CH0-None-Hero-90162: Yeah.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-91362: Good. Then follow my lead.
Drax-CH0-None-Hero-54250: No.
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-3588-0: 'Are you serious? Then go find one. I can wait a few more
  minutes. '
Drax-CH0-None-Drax-3588-1: 'I can wait a few more minutes. '
